# The hosts file at /etc/hosts is automatically generated by concatenating all hosts drop-in
# fragment files from /etc/hosts.d, with files concatenated in lexicographical order.

# To add a new value, you can deploy a Forklift package which exports a hosts fragment file
# to a target in overlays/etc/hosts.d, or you can manually create a new hosts fragment
# file in /etc/hosts.d (the file will actually be saved in /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hosts.d,
# but it will appear as if it's in /etc/hosts.d).
# To override an existing value, you should disable the Forklift package (or the feature of the
# Forklift package) which sets the value via a drop-in file; if that's not possible, you can
# directly edit the hosts fragment file in /etc/hosts.d which sets the value - your changes will
# override any identically-named file provided by Forklift until you delete the corresponding file
# with your changes from /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hosts.d and reboot.

# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the assemble-hosts.service
# systemd service. If you made any changes in /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/hosts.d,
# you will have to reboot.
