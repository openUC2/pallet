# The Origins line of the Cockpit config at /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf is automatically generated
# from origins drop-in list files in /etc/cockpit/origins.d.
# Each origins drop-in list file can consist of multiple lines, with one allowed origin per line.

# To add a new value, you can deploy a Forklift package which exports an origins drop-in file
# to a target in overlays/etc/cockpit/origins.d, or you can manually create a new origins drop-in
# file in /etc/cockpit/origins.d (the file will actually be saved in
# /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/cockpit/origins.d, but it will appear as if it's in
# /etc/cockpit/origins.d).
# To override an existing origin, you should disable the Forklift package (or the feature of the
# Forklift package) which add the origin via a drop-in file; if that's not possible, you can
# directly edit the origins drop-in file in /etc/cockpit/origins.d which adds the origin - your
# changes will override any identically-named file provided by Forklift until you delete the
# corresponding file with your changes from /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/cockpit/origins.d.

# To apply your changes immediately without rebooting, restart the
# assemble-cockpit-origins.service systemd service, then restart the assemble-cockpit-config.service
# systemd service, and then restart the cockpit.service systemd service. If you made any changes in
# /var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/cockpit/origins.d, you will have to reboot.
