<!--
The firewalld zone definition file for zone "nm-shared" at /etc/firewalld/zones/nm-shared.xml is
automatically generated by concatenating all XML drop-in fragment files from
/etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared, with files concatenated in lexicographical order.

To add a new entry, you can deploy a Forklift package which exports an XML fragment file
to a target in overlays/etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared, or you can manually create a new XML
fragment file in /etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared (the file will actually be saved in
/var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared,
but it will appear as if it's in /etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared).
To override an existing entry, you should disable the Forklift package (or the feature of the
Forklift package) which sets the entry via a drop-in file; if that's not possible, you can
directly edit the XML fragment file in /etc/firewalld/zones.d/nm-shared which sets the value -
your changes will override any identically-named file provided by Forklift until you delete the
corresponding file with your changes from
/var/lib/overlays/overrides/etc/firewalld/zones.d/zone-name and reboot.
